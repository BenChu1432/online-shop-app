                            <br/>Before You Begin:
                            <br/>ï¼ŽMoisturize your skin 1 hour before you apply the tattoo.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽUse the primer wipe included in your kit before applying your tattoo.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽApply your tattoo in a comfortable room temperature.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽDonâ€™t apply your tattoo on areas of the body that will move or crease (e.g. elbow).
                            <br/>ï¼ŽStay as still as possible for the hour while the applicator is on your skin.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>Things To Avoid:
                            <br/>ï¼ŽAvoid areas with dense hair, or shave the area 24 hours prior to application.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽAvoid scars, moles, and stretch marks.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽAvoid sensitive areas like the neck, face, upper chest, inner biceps, etc.

                            <br/>Here are a few tips for removing the applicator as seamlessly as possible:
                            <br/>
                            <br/>ï¼ŽHold the skin taut before beginning to peel.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽPeel swiftly in a continuous motion.

                            <br/>Generally, smudging is the result of too much moisture being trapped in the applicator. This happens if your body is too hot before you put on the tattoo, or there's excessive movement while the tattoo is developing.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>âœ… The most important things to remember are:
                            <br/>
                            <br/>ï¼ŽMoisturize the area 1 hour before application - it's best to use a water-based moisturizer!
                            <br/>ï¼ŽUse the Primer Wipe before applying your tattoo to make sure your skin is exfoliated and prepped for application.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽDon't reposition or reapply the tattoo once it's on your skin.
                            <br/>ï¼ŽOnce the tattoo is developing:
                            <br/>ï¼ŽAvoid any excessive movement and heat
                            <br/>ï¼ŽWear short sleeves to avoid any heat/sweat
                            <br/>ï¼ŽWhen going to bed the first night after application, wear loose fitting clothes over the tattooed area to avoid transferring overnight.

                            <br/>If you have coarse or dense hair, we recommend shaving prior to application. This is because hair acts as a barrier between the ink and skin (so the tattoo won't adhere directly!). This can cause the ink to leak, smudge, or for the tattoo to be underdeveloped.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>Light hair on the application area is fine and allows for a good transfer, but the more hair there is, the more room there is for error. If you are questioning whether or not to shave the application area, we suggest shaving it.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>ðŸ’¡ If you shave, we recommend waiting 24 hours before applying your tattoo.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>Shaving can cause micro-cuts in the skin that put the skin at higher risk of irritation. Post shaving, we suggest moisturizing the skin to heal any damage and keep it healthy for application.

                            Free Fox Fashhion tattoos are water resistant! Because our ink sinks into the top layer of the skin, it can withstand exposure to water and sweat.

                            <br/>An Free Fox tattoo and a spray tan have very similar reactions: both contain active ingredients that react with the amino acids in the first layer of the skin to change its color. We recommend applying your Inkbox prior to getting a spray tan to ensure the tattoo will reach peak darkness.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>ðŸ’¡ When wearing an Inkbox tattoo in the sun, you might get a tan mark of the tattoo.
